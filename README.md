# Big Brisket BBQ

## Project Summary

For my project I decided to focus on [Big Brisket BBQ](https://bigbrisketbarbecue.com/) website.

My reason for pursuing this particular website was due to it's lack of navigational structure:

1. There is no formal header with links to help you source through their information or a logical order to the information they have listed.

2. The menu items are located near the bottom of their homepage and their location is buried within their footer. Also, When you travel across the various pages, content becomes vastly more limited and the footer is lost along with it's vital information.

3. According to [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-bigbrisketbarbecue-com/z1q5wdxm9u?form_factor=mobile), the overall performance sits at a score of 58. The majority of the errors indicate excess Javascript code and Image files which negatively impacts the LCP when loading the site.

Beyond the syntax of the page, there are some more visual que's that do not exist that would help encourage visitors to seek out their food.

1. As this BBQ joint has limited hours, ensuring that the location and catering options are readily available would establish both availability and options to inform the visitor of their choices.

2. Understanding the clientelle are _carnivores_, or simply the general public, **and** Mr.Brisket is a one-man operation, there should be an accessible pre-order form on the site with a maximum order capacity to avoid over selling that delicous juicy goodness. This can also be adjusted to input orders within the first few hours of operation so that those who don't order digitally stand a chance.

3. Lasty, touching upon location one more time, having an embedded Google Maps on the Homepage and About page would lend a hand to those of us who have lost the survival skillset of navigating a town with our memory. Inputting an interactive map would grant access to the whereabouts without needing to tell you the go to Pilon Tools on Headquarters and follow the signs, like they do now.

It is easy to identify simple design solutions that will help build a more logical strucutre of content throughout the website creating an easy and transactional experience for both customer's and Big Brisket.
