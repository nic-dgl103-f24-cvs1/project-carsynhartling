# Big Brisket BBQ

## Project Summary

For my project I decided to focus on [Big Brisket BBQ](https://bigbrisketbarbecue.com/) website.

My reason for pursuing this particular website was due to it's lack of navigational structure:

1. There is no formal header with links to help you source through their information or a logical order to the information they have listed.

2. The menu items are located near the bottom of their homepage and their location is buried within their footer. Also, When you travel across the various pages, content becomes vastly more limited and the footer is lost along with it's vital information.

3. According to [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-bigbrisketbarbecue-com/z1q5wdxm9u?form_factor=mobile), the overall performance sits at a score of 58. The majority of the errors indicate excess Javascript code and Image files which negatively impacts the LCP when loading the site.

Beyond the syntax of the page, there are some more visual que's that do not exist that would help encourage visitors to seek out their food.

1. As this BBQ joint has limited hours, ensuring that the location and catering options are readily available would establish both availability and options to inform the visitor of their choices.

2. Understanding the clientelle are _carnivores_, or simply the general public, **and** Mr.Brisket is a one-man operation, there should be an accessible pre-order form on the site with a maximum order capacity to avoid over selling that delicous juicy goodness. This can also be adjusted to input orders within the first few hours of operation so that those who don't order digitally stand a chance.

3. Lasty, touching upon location one more time, having an embedded Google Maps on the Homepage and About page would lend a hand to those of us who have lost the survival skillset of navigating a town with our memory. Inputting an interactive map would grant access to the whereabouts without needing to tell you the go to Pilon Tools on Headquarters and follow the signs, like they do now.

It is easy to identify simple design solutions that will help build a more logical strucutre of content throughout the website creating an easy and transactional experience for both customer's and Big Brisket.

## Look and Feel

My inspiration for this site is after an old _neighbor_ of mine, [Lil' Ronnies BBQ](https://www.lilronniesbbq.com/). This a local restuarant located in Tofino, BC and was initially just a man and his smoker. Their success breached both from their ability to whip up a hell of a margitas alongside their marketing strategies. They have designed an atmosphere digitally that matches the tone of their Tiki-hut _laid back_ attitudes, touching the hearts of hipsters and hippies alike. Owner, Ronnie Lee, has now gone on to open a catering business aligned with their BBQ and has fused together food with entertainment for all.

For my guy, Big Brisket, I want to fuse this beefy aesthetic with a rugged, worn polish. The mood will, hopefully, suggest a lively back-yard BBQ feeling while holding a clean-cut and sleek appearance. Business in the front, party in the back.

- Colors will be a mix of primarily blacks with nuetral browns and accented colors of yellow and salmon pink.

- Fonts will be a mix between Ubuntu and Athity, both simulate a relaxed typeface and pair nicely as a family.

- Images will be a blend between found and sourced, their website and social media has a selection of their products. Many of the found images are planned to be used as textures. I will use their logo:
